# Status

Last updated: 2026-05-25

## Current MVP

- Provider Studio supports manual service creation and OpenAPI import.
- OpenAPI import can discover multiple endpoints, preview generated cards, select many drafts, and publish them.
- Registered services expose manifests, preview data, paid invocation, and feedback events.
- AgentRouter can search registered services, select a likely service, construct simple input, invoke through the connector, and summarize the result.
- AgentRouter is available as:
  - CLI: `node bin/agent-router.js ask "<task>"`
  - HTTP: `POST /agent-router/ask`
- AgentRouter currently recognizes address lookup, BTC/perp liquidation max-pain, generic netflow, Nansen-style smart-money netflow, and smart-money holdings intents.
- Local provider configs using `/provider/custom/...` are rebound to the current server port at startup, so old generated JSON does not pin the app to a stale local port.
- Wallet/payment defaults to dev-mode x402-style proof. `circle_arc` mode now supports local-wallet Arc Testnet USDC transfers to provider payout wallets with provider-side tx verification.
- Agora hackathon positioning is captured in `docs/PRD_AGORA_HACKATHON.md`: AgentRouter Markets, a paid market-intelligence routing layer for trading agents.
- The PRD now treats `/agent-router/request` as the formal structured protocol endpoint and `/agent-router/ask` as a demo/fallback wrapper.
- Implemented `GET /capabilities` for a machine-readable capability catalog.
- Implemented `POST /agent-router/request` for deterministic structured routing.
- Implemented `/agent-router/demo` as the demand-side hackathon console.
- Paid invocation feedback now includes an `agent_router_settlement_receipt_v1` settlement receipt with USDC amount, mode, network, payee, and tx hash.
- Local `circle_arc` calls now include Arc Testnet chain metadata, direct-provider-wallet settlement model, payment event hash, and feedback hash.
- Search results now expose `trust_score`; structured routing returns provider selection reasons.
- Verified the full provider-to-demand flow: Provider Studio OpenAPI import publishes `get_liquidation_max_pain`; AgentRouter `/ask` compiles natural language into a structured `perp_liquidation_max_pain` request, selects the uploaded service, pays, validates, and returns data.
- OpenAPI capability inference now enriches imported liquidation services with the standard `perp_liquidation`, `liquidation_heatmap`, and `perp_liquidation_max_pain` capabilities.
- Deployed AgentRouter Markets to Render at `https://agentrouter.network`.
- Claude/Codex Skill and MCP defaults now point to the Render endpoint instead of the temporary Cloudflare/Railway endpoints.
- Added payment backend abstraction: `dev`, `x402`, `omniagentpay`, and `circle_arc`.
- Added `POST /agent-router/quote` so agents can inspect selected service, input, price, and guard result before paying.
- Product positioning updated: AgentRouter is not a payment SDK; OmniAgentPay/Circle/x402 can be payment execution backends.
- Added `bin/agent-router-mcp.js`, a zero-dependency MCP stdio server for Claude/Desktop-style clients. This is now the preferred Claude integration because hosted Claude may block outbound access to `trycloudflare.com` and `railway.app`.
- Updated the AgentRouter skill into a GitHub-distributable bootstrap skill: it checks for existing AgentRouter MCP tools, chooses the best client-specific install path, and falls back to HTTP only when appropriate.
- Tightened protocol boundaries: `/agent-router/request` and MCP `agentrouter_request` are the preferred production-like paths; `/agent-router/ask` is only a demo/fallback natural-language wrapper.
- Structured requests now return `agent_router_evidence_v1`, including `manifest_hash`, `config_hash`, `input_hash`, `output_hash`, `payment_tx`, `verification_report`, `trace_hash`, and Arc anchor metadata.
- Added `GET /agent-router/evidence` and `GET /agent-router/trust` so the MVP shows where offchain trust state lives and what can later be anchored on Arc.
- Added lightweight `agent_router_route_observation_v1` records and `GET /agent-router/observations` so structured routing accumulates candidate, score, selection, verification, and feedback data for future learned routing without adding a heavy training system.
- Added Claude Desktop Extension package source in `mcpb/agentrouter` and generated `/Users/huazhenghao/Downloads/Arc/agentrouter.mcpb` for no-command local installation.
- `mcpb validate mcpb/agentrouter` passes and `mcpb pack mcpb/agentrouter` succeeds.
- Added publish-ready npm/npx MCP package source in `packages/agentrouter-mcp` with target package name `@agentrouter/mcp`.
- Added `npm run mcp:npm:check` and `npm run mcp:npm:pack` to validate the npm package before publication.
- Provider Studio now treats validation as a registration gate: services are only published when the endpoint can be invoked and returns a valid AgentRouter envelope. Failed API calls are reported with validation details and are not persisted into the registry.
- Imported provider manifests now include inferred input schemas and an `agent_data_service_contract_v1` block with example questions, shape summaries, and quality expectations.
- Data quality verification now records deterministic checks for schema, envelope, freshness, coverage, empty result, confidence, data shape, and an overall quality score. Trust snapshots include freshness, coverage, and agent-friendliness signals.
- Route failures now return `failure_explanation` so clients can distinguish "no service found" from "service found and invoked, but upstream rejected the request."
- Added service provenance, health, badges, recent failure rate, and quality-event feeds to the registry view. Agents can now inspect `GET /agent-router/services`, `GET /agent-router/service?service_id=...`, and `GET /agent-router/quality?service_id=...`.
- Paid service calls now create `agent_service_quality_event_v1` records with deterministic verification, HTTP status, business-error detection, blocking issues, and a post-call feedback expectation for the caller agent.
- Local-wallet paid calls now report completed invocations back to the registry through `POST /agent-router/calls/complete`, where the server verifies the Arc USDC payment tx, records an evidence trace keyed by `request_id`, attaches deterministic verification, and returns a consumer-feedback request for the main agent.
- `GET /agent-router/evidence` and `GET /agent-router/feedback` can now filter by `request_id`, and `POST /agent-router/feedback` can accept a unique `request_id` without exposing service IDs to the user-visible agent response.
- The MCP server now exposes `agentrouter_feedback`, so the main agent can submit intent fit, answer usefulness, missing fields, and confidence after it decides whether the paid result answered the user.
- Evidence and consumer feedback now support Arc Testnet hash anchoring. Full evidence stays offchain; `trace_hash`, `result_hash`, `verification_hash`, payment tx hash, and feedback hash are anchored through `contracts/AgentRouterEvidenceAnchor.sol` when `ADN_ARC_ANCHOR_CONTRACT` and `ADN_ARC_ANCHOR_PRIVATE_KEY` are configured. Local tests use `ADN_ARC_ANCHOR_MODE=mock`.
- Consumer feedback now supports ERC-8004 Reputation Registry submission on Arc Testnet. In the real local-wallet flow, the server records feedback and Arc evidence anchors, then the demand-side consumer wallet submits ERC-8004 Reputation feedback to avoid provider/operator self-feedback. Local tests use `ADN_ERC8004_MODE=mock`.
- Published services can expose ERC-8004 Agent Registration Files at `/.well-known/erc8004/agents/:service_id.json` and register an ERC-8004 Identity Registry token through `POST /services/:service_id/erc8004/register`. The returned `agent_id` is written back into the manifest and becomes the target for later Reputation Registry feedback.
- Published services now include `manifest_type: hosted_http_data_api`, `version`, structured routing metadata, `manifest_hash`, `config_hash`, optional `/.well-known/agentrouter.json` origin-binding metadata, and ERC-8257-compatible tool manifest metadata at `/.well-known/erc8257/tools/:service_id.json`.
- Router scoring now considers consumer feedback, recent failure rate, service health, and source provenance instead of ranking only by capability/text match and price.
- Added `POST /agent-router/health-check` for registry-driven live health checks; service details expose recent validation, health, quality, and feedback events.
- Deployed a real AgentRouter evidence anchor contract on Arc Testnet and verified a live paid data request end-to-end:
  - Local demand wallet paid Arc Testnet USDC to the provider payout wallet.
  - Server verified the payment tx before returning data.
  - Server anchored the evidence trace and consumer feedback hashes on Arc Testnet.
  - Consumer wallet submitted ERC-8004 Reputation feedback for the provider agent.
  - The completed request record includes payment verification, deterministic data verification, evidence trace hash, feedback anchor tx, and ERC-8004 reputation tx.

## Known Useful Local Flow

```bash
PORT=8800 npm start
curl -fsSL -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8800/agent-router/ask \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task":"BTC当前最大爆仓痛点是多少","max_price":"0.05"}'
```

For any MCP-capable AI agent client, add the AgentRouter MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AgentRouter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@agentrouter/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_ROUTER_URL": "https://agentrouter.network",
        "AGENT_ROUTER_MAX_PRICE": "0.05"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Temporary tunnels and some hosted domains may be blocked by Claude's remote network policy.

The Matrixport address demo depends on the upstream Lookonchain-style API at `127.0.0.1:3456`. If that upstream is not running, the service can remain registered but fail validation/invocation.

## Next Decisions

- Keep heuristic natural-language handling only as `/agent-router/ask` demo/fallback logic.
- Use route observations as the first lightweight dataset for improving provider ranking before considering graph models or learned rankers.
- Productize the Arc operator key path so server deployments use secure secret storage instead of manual shell env injection.
- Deploy the updated consumer-wallet ERC-8004 feedback flow to the hosted Render service.
- Decide whether to keep `dev` payment mode available only for tests, and keep public hosted endpoints on real payment enforcement.
- Add a one-command provider onboarding path after the GUI stabilizes.
- For the hackathon build, polish the demo around the verified path: provider identity, x402-style Arc payment, evidence anchor, ERC-8004 feedback, and trust score update.
