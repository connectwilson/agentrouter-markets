# Agent Native Data Network MVP

Local MVP for an Agent-native paid data service network.

It demonstrates:

- Discovery Connector bootstrap entry for Codex / Claude / Cursor-style agents
- Service Registry
- Provider service manifest
- Sample response preview
- Provider onboarding validation
- Hosted HTTP Provider Runtime with private Provider Secret
- Optional Postgres-backed persistent registry and encrypted provider secret vault
- x402-style HTTP 402 payment challenge and retry flow
- Local Alice Agent Wallet with budget policy
- Agent-friendly `agent_data_envelope_v1` response
- ERC-8004-compatible identity metadata fields
- Feedback event generation after paid invocation

## Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

The test suite starts local HTTP servers, uses temporary runtime directories for wallet/provider state, validates services, performs discovery, previews sample responses, completes paid invocations, checks feedback, and verifies provider configs can be reloaded after restart.

```

## Run Demo

```bash
npm run demo
```

Expected flow:

```text
Discovery Connector -> Registry search -> Manifest -> Preview -> 402 challenge -> dev x402 payment proof -> paid result -> feedback event -> final analysis
```

## Start Server

```bash
npm start
```

The server binds to `127.0.0.1:8787` by default and seeds the demo service.

Open the Provider Studio GUI:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787/studio
```

## Persistent Registry

By default, the MVP uses in-memory registry state plus local provider files. That is fine for local development, but hosted instances can restart and lose runtime files.

For production-style deployments, set:

```text
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
ADN_PROVIDER_SECRET_PASSPHRASE=<stable-32+-char-secret>
```

When `DATABASE_URL` is present, Provider Studio writes provider configs to Postgres and stores provider credentials as encrypted secret records. On every restart, AgentRouter reloads registered providers from the database, so a provider only needs to publish once.

`ADN_PROVIDER_SECRET_PASSPHRASE` is a platform encryption key, not a provider API key. It must stay stable across deploys. Rotating it without re-encrypting secrets will make existing provider credentials unreadable.

Do not add provider-owned API keys such as BlockBeats, Nansen, or other upstream keys to hosted deployment environment variables as the normal onboarding path. Providers enter their credentials in Provider Studio; the platform stores encrypted secret records in the persistent registry. Hosted deployments that require persistence, such as Render, reject Provider Studio publish requests unless `DATABASE_URL` and a stable `ADN_PROVIDER_SECRET_PASSPHRASE` are configured.

Environment-variable provider bootstrap is disabled by default and exists only for temporary local tests:

```text
ADN_ENABLE_ENV_PROVIDER_BOOTSTRAP=true
```

## CLI Connector

With the server running:

```bash
node bin/adn.js wallet init
node bin/adn.js search "Base 7d fund flow"
node bin/adn.js manifest chain_fund_flow_7d_base
node bin/adn.js preview chain_fund_flow_7d_base
node bin/adn.js invoke chain_fund_flow_7d_base '{"chain":"base","days":7}'
node bin/adn.js route "BTC 当前最大爆仓痛点是多少" --max-price 0.05 --freshness 300
node bin/adn.js feedback chain_fund_flow_7d_base
```

Set a custom registry URL:

```bash
ADN_REGISTRY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 node bin/adn.js search "Base 7d fund flow"
```

## Agent Router

The router is the MVP version of the Agent capability routing layer. The formal protocol is structured: the main agent parses the user's request, asks `/capabilities` for supported schemas when needed, then sends a capability request to `/agent-router/request`. AgentRouter validates the schema, selects a matching service, quotes the payment, performs a paid invocation, verifies the result, and returns an evidence envelope.

`/agent-router/ask` remains a demo fallback for natural-language testing. It is not the core protocol and should not be treated as the semantic parser in production.

Example:

```bash
ADN_REGISTRY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
node bin/adn.js route "BTC 当前最大爆仓痛点是多少" --max-price 0.05 --freshness 300
```

For this ambiguous crypto query, the router returns `route_with_assumption` and explicitly states that it interpreted "爆仓痛点" as perpetual futures liquidation max-pain, not options max pain. If the task only says "BTC 最大痛点是多少", the router returns `needs_clarification` instead of guessing.

Router response fields include:

- `protocol`
- `request`
- `normalized_intent`
- `intent_confidence`
- `assumptions`
- `ambiguities`
- `selected_service`
- `candidates_considered`
- `verification`
- `evidence`
- `result`

Structured request example:

```bash
curl -fsSL -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/agent-router/request \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"capability":"perp_liquidation_max_pain","params":{"asset":"BTC","market_type":"perpetual_futures","window":"current"},"constraints":{"max_price_usdc":"0.05","freshness_seconds":300}}'
```

The returned `evidence` object includes `trace_hash`, `result_hash`, `verification_hash`, payment receipt metadata, and an Arc hash anchor. Full evidence remains offchain; Arc stores the integrity/timestamp trail through `contracts/AgentRouterEvidenceAnchor.sol` when `ADN_ARC_ANCHOR_CONTRACT` and `ADN_ARC_ANCHOR_PRIVATE_KEY` are configured.

## Alice Wallet

The MVP supports scheme A from the product discussion: Alice gets a local Agent Wallet controlled by the CLI.

Initialize it once:

```bash
export ADN_WALLET_PASSPHRASE="choose-a-local-demo-passphrase"
node bin/adn.js wallet init
node bin/adn.js wallet address
node bin/adn.js wallet status
```

Set local spend limits:

```bash
node bin/adn.js wallet policy set --per-call 0.05 --daily 2
```

View local payment history:

```bash
node bin/adn.js wallet log
node bin/adn.js payment plan
```

When Claude / Codex calls `adn invoke`, the CLI:

1. Fetches the service manifest
2. Requests the provider endpoint
3. Receives HTTP 402 payment requirements
4. Checks Alice's local policy
5. Signs a dev x402 payment proof, or sends an Arc Testnet USDC transfer in `circle_arc` mode
6. Retries the provider request
7. Records the payment in `.adn/payments.log`

No manual signature is required for payments inside policy limits. Payments above policy limits are rejected instead of prompting, which keeps CLI use safe inside Agent workflows.

### Wallet Safety Guardrails

The MVP treats Alice's wallet as a local Agent hot wallet with policy checks. The AI never chooses `pay_to` or `amount`; `adn invoke` derives those from the service manifest and the provider's HTTP 402 challenge.

Implemented guardrails:

- `.adn/` is gitignored
- wallet private key is encrypted at rest with `ADN_WALLET_PASSPHRASE`
- payments require a complete HTTP 402 challenge
- payment proof binds `service_id`, `amount`, `network`, `asset`, `pay_to`, `nonce`, expiry, resource hash, and Arc tx hash when using Arc settlement
- `circle_arc` mode verifies the Arc ERC-20 USDC transfer before returning provider data
- provider rejects replayed challenge nonces
- wallet policy enforces per-call and daily limits
- wallet policy can restrict services, providers, and payment targets
- `adn wallet lock` disables automatic signing
- wallet payment log records challenge nonce and payment target

### Arc Evidence and ERC-8004 Trust

After a paid call, AgentRouter records:

- evidence trace hash, result hash, verification hash, and payment tx hash
- deterministic verification metadata
- consumer-agent feedback
- ERC-8004 Reputation Registry feedback when configured

The custom Arc evidence anchor keeps the full call trace auditable without putting raw API data onchain. ERC-8004 provides the standard reputation surface for provider/service trust.

Each published service can expose an ERC-8004 Agent Registration File and register an onchain identity:

```bash
curl -fsSL -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8800/services/chain_fund_flow_7d_base/erc8004/register \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

Agent metadata is served at:

```text
/.well-known/erc8004/agents/:service_id.json
```

Useful server config:

```bash
ADN_ARC_ANCHOR_CONTRACT=0x...
ADN_ARC_ANCHOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
ADN_ERC8004_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
ADN_ERC8004_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
ADN_ERC8004_AGENT_ID=1001
ADN_ERC8004_METADATA_BASE_URL=https://agentrouter.network
ADN_ERC8004_IDENTITY_REGISTRY=0x8004A818BFB912233c491871b3d84c89A494BD9e
ADN_ERC8004_REPUTATION_REGISTRY=0x8004B663056A597Dffe9eCcC1965A193B7388713
```

Useful commands:

```bash
node bin/adn.js wallet lock
node bin/adn.js wallet unlock
node bin/adn.js wallet policy set --service-allowlist chain_fund_flow_7d_base
node bin/adn.js wallet policy set --provider-allowlist provider_bob
node bin/adn.js wallet policy set --pay-to-allowlist 0xProviderDemoWallet000000000000000000000000
```

Still TODO for production hardening:

- OS keychain integration
- separate signer daemon
- session wallet / spending-cap smart account
- escrow/claim contract for batching, refunds, platform fees, and dispute windows

## Payment Modes

The MVP defaults to:

```bash
ADN_PAYMENT_BACKEND=dev
```

To demo real Arc settlement from Alice's local wallet to the provider payout wallet:

```bash
ADN_PAYMENT_BACKEND=circle_arc
ADN_ARC_RPC_URL=https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
ADN_PROVIDER_RECEIVE_ADDRESS=0xProviderPayoutWallet
```

Provider Studio also has an optional `Arc payout wallet` field. In `circle_arc` mode the provider endpoint returns an x402-style HTTP 402 challenge, Alice's local MCP/CLI wallet sends an Arc Testnet USDC transfer to that payout address, and the provider verifies the transaction hash before returning data.

In dev mode, the provider still returns an x402-style HTTP 402 challenge, but the CLI signs a local development payment proof instead of settling real USDC.

AgentRouter treats payment as an adapter boundary. It is not intended to compete with full payment SDKs such as OmniAgentPay; those can become execution backends while AgentRouter remains responsible for capability discovery, provider selection, result verification, and trust feedback.

Supported backend names:

```bash
ADN_PAYMENT_BACKEND=dev
ADN_PAYMENT_BACKEND=x402
ADN_PAYMENT_BACKEND=omniagentpay
ADN_PAYMENT_BACKEND=circle_arc
```

Quote a route before paying:

```bash
node bin/agent-router.js quote '{"capability":"perp_liquidation_max_pain","params":{"asset":"BTC","market_type":"perpetual_futures","window":"current"},"constraints":{"max_price_usdc":"0.05"}}'
```

## Login / OAuth

The website header includes a `Login` entry. This MVP supports GitHub OAuth when the matching environment variables are present:

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

Register these callback URLs with GitHub:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8800/auth/github/callback
https://agentrouter.network/auth/github/callback
```

OAuth is for user identity only. Provider-owned API credentials still belong in Provider Studio/provider secret storage, not OAuth environment variables.

## Safe Skill Install

The default shell-capable agent entrypoint downloads the AgentRouter Skill markdown directly. It does not execute a remote shell script and does not clone GitHub:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agents/skills/agentrouter" "$HOME/.claude/skills/agentrouter" "$HOME/.codex/skills/agentrouter" && curl -fsSL https://agentrouter.network/skills/AgentRouter/SKILL.md -o "$HOME/.agents/skills/agentrouter/SKILL.md" && cp "$HOME/.agents/skills/agentrouter/SKILL.md" "$HOME/.claude/skills/agentrouter/SKILL.md" && cp "$HOME/.agents/skills/agentrouter/SKILL.md" "$HOME/.codex/skills/agentrouter/SKILL.md"
```

For agents that already support the `skills` CLI and GitHub cloning, this also works:

```bash
npx -y skills@latest add connectwilson/agentrouter-skill --skill AgentRouter -g -y --copy
```

The skill teaches Claude, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes, Cursor, Windsurf, and similar agents when to use AgentRouter. If MCP tools are not attached, the skill can still call the hosted AgentRouter network through the GitHub npx CLI fallback:

```bash
AGENT_ROUTER_URL=https://agentrouter.network \
AGENT_ROUTER_MAX_PRICE=0.05 \
npx -y --package github:connectwilson/agentrouter-markets#main agent-router ask "BTC liquidation max pain"
```

For local terminals where you are comfortable auditing and running the installer script, the advanced installer remains available:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://agentrouter.network/install.sh | bash
```

This mirrors the Surf-style split: one safe command installs the skill, and the skill tells the agent which HTTP, CLI, or MCP path to use for live data.

## Remote MCP Connector

For Claude web, Claude Managed Agents, and any product that supports URL-based Remote MCP, add this connector URL:

```text
https://agentrouter.network/mcp
```

Claude custom connectors can connect to any third-party remote MCP server URL. Managed Agents declare URL MCP servers in `mcp_servers` and require servers to support the streamable HTTP transport.

## Universal MCP Integration

The runtime integration is a universal MCP server: any MCP-capable AI client calls AgentRouter locally, and the MCP server forwards requests to either the Render deployment at `https://agentrouter.network` or your local AgentRouter server.

Run the MCP server with npx:

```bash
npx -y --package github:connectwilson/agentrouter-markets#main agent-router-mcp
```

Run this MCP command in a terminal or put the command/args into an MCP client config. For Claude Code chat-style installation, use the Skill install command above.

Most AI clients configure MCP like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AgentRouter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package", "github:connectwilson/agentrouter-markets#main", "agent-router-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_ROUTER_URL": "https://agentrouter.network",
        "AGENT_ROUTER_MAX_PRICE": "0.05"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a local AgentRouter server:

```bash
PORT=8800 npm start
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AgentRouter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package", "github:connectwilson/agentrouter-markets#main", "agent-router-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_ROUTER_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8800",
        "AGENT_ROUTER_MAX_PRICE": "0.05"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Optional Claude Desktop Extension

Claude Desktop users can also install the packaged extension:

```text
/Users/huazhenghao/Downloads/Arc/agentrouter.mcpb
```

In Claude Desktop:

```text
Settings -> Extensions -> Install Extension -> choose agentrouter.mcpb
```

When prompted, keep:

```text
AgentRouter URL = https://agentrouter.network
Default Max Price = 0.05
```

Build or rebuild the package:

```bash
npm run mcpb:pack
```

Validate the extension manifest:

```bash
mcpb validate mcpb/agentrouter
```

The MCP server exposes:

- `agentrouter_request`: preferred structured request -> route -> invoke -> verify -> evidence
- `agentrouter_ask`: last-resort natural-language fallback -> route -> invoke -> verify
- `agentrouter_quote`: structured request -> quote and budget guard only
- `agentrouter_capabilities`: capability catalog and schemas

## Universal npm / npx MCP Install

For Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Continue, VS Code, and other MCP-capable clients, the portable install path is npm/npx.

Package source:

```text
packages/agentrouter-mcp
```

Target package name:

```text
@agentrouter/mcp
```

Until `@agentrouter/mcp` is published to npm, use the GitHub npx package form:

```bash
npx -y --package github:connectwilson/agentrouter-markets#main agent-router-mcp
```

MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AgentRouter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package", "github:connectwilson/agentrouter-markets#main", "agent-router-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_ROUTER_URL": "https://agentrouter.network",
        "AGENT_ROUTER_MAX_PRICE": "0.05"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Local development config before publishing:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AgentRouter": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/huazhenghao/Downloads/Arc/packages/agentrouter-mcp/bin/agentrouter-mcp.js"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_ROUTER_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8800",
        "AGENT_ROUTER_MAX_PRICE": "0.05"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Validate the npm package:

```bash
npm run mcp:npm:check
npm run mcp:npm:pack
```

## GitHub Skill Bootstrap

The installable skill in `claude-skills/agent-router/SKILL.md` is intentionally written as a universal bootstrap:

1. It first checks whether AgentRouter MCP tools are already available.
2. If not, it detects the current AI client where possible.
3. It picks the best install path for that client: Remote MCP, local MCP bridge, Desktop Extension, or HTTP fallback.
4. Once connected, it uses AgentRouter generically for any registered API/data service.

After publishing the skill folder to GitHub, users can ask their AI client:

```text
请从这个 GitHub 链接安装 AgentRouter Skill，并用 AgentRouter 帮我查询数据：
<YOUR_GITHUB_SKILL_URL>
```

For best results, the GitHub URL should point directly to the `agent-router` skill folder or a repo whose root contains `SKILL.md`.

Inspect the production migration checklist:

```bash
node bin/adn.js payment plan
```

Production x402 integration should replace:

- buyer-side `createWalletPaymentProof` with an official x402 exact EVM client payment authorization where a facilitator supports the target chain
- seller-side `verifyDevPaymentProof` with facilitator `/verify` and `/settle`
- demo payment requirements with official x402 payment requirements
- local mock anchors with real `EvidenceAnchored` and `FeedbackAnchored` events on Arc Testnet; `circle_arc` already supports a direct Arc Testnet USDC transfer proof path for local-wallet calls

Relevant runtime configuration:

```bash
ADN_PAYMENT_BACKEND=dev
ADN_PAYMENT_BACKEND=circle_arc
ADN_ARC_RPC_URL=https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
ADN_PROVIDER_RECEIVE_ADDRESS=0x...
ADN_ARC_ANCHOR_CONTRACT=0x...
ADN_ARC_ANCHOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
ADN_X402_FACILITATOR_URL=https://x402.org/facilitator
```

## Provider Onboarding

Start the server first:

```bash
npm start
```

### GUI

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787/studio
```

The form supports:

- `static-json`
- `hosted-http`
- OpenAPI / Swagger import

Provider Studio generates service IDs, provider IDs, and default capability tags from the service title, provider name, and agent-facing description. These fields remain editable under advanced settings for stable integrations.

Click **Create, Register, Validate** to generate provider config, register the service, run validation, and get next-step CLI commands.

Use **Fill Hosted Demo** to populate a working hosted HTTP example that calls the local mock upstream endpoint.

Use **Import API Collection** when one provider API has many data endpoints. Paste one API base URL and Studio will try the direct URL plus `/openapi.json`, `/swagger.json`, and `/.well-known/openapi.json`.

The importer generates one service draft per data endpoint, skips operational endpoints such as `/auth`, `/health`, `/metrics`, and `/debug`, then lets Bob review or edit the drafts before publishing. The local demo API is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787/mock/api
```

This creates separate services, such as funding-rate and liquidation max-pain, instead of hiding many endpoints behind one large service.

### CLI

In another terminal, run the guided onboarding flow:

```bash
node bin/adn.js provider onboard
```

Default mode is `static-json`. The CLI asks for:

- title
- provider name
- agent-facing description
- capability tags, suggested automatically from the title and description
- price
- example request JSON
- preview data JSON
- paid result data JSON
- paid response summary

Then it automatically:

1. Generates `providers/<service_id>.json`
2. Builds a service manifest
3. Registers the service with the local Registry
4. Runs Validator against the generated endpoint
5. Returns next-step commands for search, preview, and invoke

For a non-interactive smoke test:

```bash
node bin/adn.js provider onboard --yes
node bin/adn.js search "sentiment demo"
node bin/adn.js preview community_sentiment_demo
node bin/adn.js wallet init
node bin/adn.js invoke community_sentiment_demo '{"asset":"ETH","window":"7d"}'
```

### Hosted HTTP Mode

Hosted HTTP mode lets Bob publish a paid service without running his own public endpoint. The platform-hosted Provider Runtime calls Bob's configured upstream endpoint after payment.

Smoke test:

```bash
node bin/adn.js provider onboard --mode hosted-http --yes
node bin/adn.js search "hosted http sentiment"
node bin/adn.js preview hosted_http_sentiment_demo
node bin/adn.js wallet init
node bin/adn.js invoke hosted_http_sentiment_demo '{"asset":"ETH","window":"7d"}'
```

In hosted HTTP mode, the submitted Provider Secret is moved into the local encrypted Provider Secret store:

```text
.adn/provider-secrets.json
```

It is encrypted with `ADN_PROVIDER_SECRET_PASSPHRASE`, falling back to `ADN_WALLET_PASSPHRASE` for local MVP demos.

When `DATABASE_URL` is enabled, `ADN_PROVIDER_SECRET_PASSPHRASE` is required. Local fallback keys are intentionally not used for persistent hosted credentials because they can disappear across deploys and make stored provider secrets unreadable.

The generated provider config only includes a secret reference:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "type": "hosted_http",
    "auth": {
      "secret_name": "PROVIDER_SECRET",
      "secret_ref": "hosted_http_sentiment_demo:PROVIDER_SECRET"
    }
  }
}
```

That secret is runtime config only. It is not copied into the public manifest:

```json
{
  "runtime_secrets": {
    "required": true,
    "custody": "hosted_runtime_config",
    "public": false
  }
}
```

This keeps the product framing as “publish a paid data capability service” rather than “publish an API key.” The current MVP uses a local encrypted secret store as a stand-in for a production vault.

The current configurable provider runtime supports `static_json` and `hosted_http`. The next source adapters should be `cli_command`, `mcp_tool`, and production vault-backed `hosted_http`.

## Important MVP Note

The default payment implementation is a local development x402-compatible handshake: the Provider returns HTTP 402, the CLI creates a wallet-signed dev payment proof, then retries the request. For Agora/Arc demos, `ADN_PAYMENT_BACKEND=circle_arc` switches local MCP/CLI calls to direct Arc Testnet USDC transfer settlement: Alice pays the provider payout wallet, the provider verifies the tx, and the response includes settlement, payment event, and feedback hashes.
